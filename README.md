This contains some of the classes used for the SpaceWar game(More to come in the future when the Game is published). It includes classes PowerUp and Shop.

The class PowerUp makes the powerups and allows them to fall from random points on the screen down. If the player collects any of them, they will receive a unique ability that will assist them in fighting off the aliens.

The class Shop is used to buy upgrades for the player using an in game currecy called "points" that can be collected by shooting down aliens. The class allows you to make purchases on specific upgrades that will benifit and improve the gameplay by adding powerups and overall making your ship stronger.
